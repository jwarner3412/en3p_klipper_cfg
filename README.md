My klipper config.

Broke printer.cfg apart and put the pieces in lib folder and use [include lib/*.cfg]

The klipper macro library is also installed in the lib folder. If your trying my config out, things will not work until klipper macros library is installed there.

NOT USING STOCK THERMISTOR! Change it in printer.cfg

Using homeassistant smart plug to cycle printer power so you'll have to adjust all those settings too.
